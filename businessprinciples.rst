Solution space
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| Never try to use technical solutions to a non-technical problem.
| **Rationale**
| Of course some IT and technology can help to solve problems, but
  technology and IT is never enough. A non technical activity, process,
  behaviour change, etc is always needed.  
| **Implications**
| Do not focus on technology and IT solution only when solving problems.
   

Start simple
^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| Start simple.
| **Rationale**
| Start simple. Build a high quality solution to a real problem for a
  cohesive group of people. If you solve one problem really well, then
  you can move on to the next problem (one simple approach at a time)
  instead of trying to tackle several things at once and, as a result,
  not really solving anything. Product development is about earning the
  right to build the next thing.
| **Implications**
| Complexity will come later when having invest lots of time and money
  and simple adjustments have more impact. Fixes will be more complex
  when products are mature anyway due to backward compatibility
  requirements.

Create a MVP fast
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| If your MVP takes a year to build…it’s not an MVP.
| **Rationale**
| Creating a MVP should take not more than 1 month.
| **Implications**
| A created MVP is not ready for sale, but ready to learn from for later
  stages.

First, make it easy. Then make it fast.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| First, make it easy. Then make it fast. Then make it pretty.
| **Rationale**
| When launching a new product cost are high. Making a good performing
  product is complex and expensive. So when working on a MVP, try to
  make a product easy to use and easy to create. Focus on UX.
| **Implications**
| Difficult back-end performance and scaling issues are handled later.
  This can increase development cost if performance is never accounted for
  in a design.

Use Open Data, Open Standards, Open Source, and Open Innovation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| Use Open Data, Open Standards, Open Source, and Open Innovation
| **Rationale**
| Too often in international development, scarce, public resources are
  spent investing in code, tools, and innovations that are either locked
  away behind proprietary, fee-based firewalls, or created in a bespoke
  way for use in sector-specific silos.  This principle: Use Open Data,
  Open Standards, Open Source, and Open Innovation provides a framework
  to consider an “open” approach to technology-enabled international
  development.
| **Implications**

-  Adopt and expand existing open standards.
-  Open data and functionalities and expose them in documented APIs
   (Application Programming Interfaces) where use by a larger community
   is possible.
-  Invest in software as a public good.
-  Develop software to be open source by default with the code made
   available in public repositories and supported through developer
   communities.

| 

Strategic focus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| Investment decisions are driven by business requirements
| **Rationale**
| Core government needs and priorities should be the primary drivers for
  investment. Investment decisions should be defined by the agency’s
  vision and strategic plans as well as the requirements of the
  business. These should also take into account whole-of-government
  strategic guidance. A business-led and business outcome-oriented
  architecture is more successful in meeting strategic goals, responding
  to changing needs and serving consumer expectations. Government
  service requirements will define any required technological support.
| **Implications**
| Agencies need to align with whole-of-government strategic direction. •
  Agency’s strategic plans need to align with whole-of-government
  strategic direction. • Investment decisions should be made in
  accordance with the agency’s vision and strategic plan. • Changes to
  processes, applications and technology should be made in response to
  an approved business initiative. • Design of business solutions will
  need to be aligned with, and traceable to strategic goals and
  outcomes. • Services, processes and applications will need to be
  designed from the perspective of the service user. • Building or
  redevelopment of applications and solutions will be undertaken only
  after business processes have been analysed, simplified or otherwise
  redesigned as appropriate. • Applications are delivered in a
  collaborative partnership with the business owners to enable solutions
  to meet user-defined requirements for functionality, service levels,
  cost and delivery timing.

Make things open: it makes things better
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| Make things open: it makes things better
| **Rationale**
| We should share what we’re doing whenever we can. With colleagues,
  with users, with the world. Share code, share designs, share ideas,
  share intentions, share failures. The more eyes there are on a service
  the better it gets — howlers are spotted, better alternatives are
  pointed out, the bar is raised. Much of what we’re doing is only
  possible because of open source code and the generosity of the web
  design community. We should pay that back.
| **Implications**

Maximise Benefit to the Enterprise
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| Information management decisions are made to provide maximum benefit
  to the enterprise as a whole.
| **Rationale**
| This principle embodies ‘‘service above self ’’. Decisions made from
  an enterprise-wide perspective have greater long-term value than
  decisions made from any particular organisational perspective. Maximum
  return on investment requires information management decisions to
  adhere to enterprise-wide drivers and priorities. No Organisation Unit
  will detract from the benefit of the whole. However, this principle
  will not preclude any Organisation Unit from getting its job done.
| **Implications**
| Achieving maximum enterprise-wide benefit will require changes in the
  way we plan and manage information. Technology alone will not bring
  about this change. Some organisations may have to concede their own
  preferences for the greater benefit of the entire enterprise.
  Application development priorities must be established by the entire
  enterprise for the entire enterprise. Applications components should
  be shared across organisational boundaries. Information management
  initiatives should be conducted in accordance with the enterprise
  plan. Individual organisations should pursue information management
  initiatives which conform to the blueprints and priorities established
  by the enterprise. We will change the plan as we need to.

Maximize Benefit to the complete enterprise
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| Information management decisions are made to provide maximum benefit
  to the enterprise as a whole.
| **Rationale**
| Decisions made from an enterprise-wide perspective have greater
  long-term value than decisions made from any particular organizational
  perspective. Maximum return on investment requires information
  management decisions to adhere to enterprise-wide drivers and
  priorities. No minority group will detract from the benefit of the
  whole. However, this principle will not preclude any minority group
  from getting its job done.
| **Implications**
| Application development priorities must be established by the entire
  enterprise for the entire enterprise. Strong enterprise governance is
  required. Information services should be shared across organizational
  boundaries. Information management initiatives should be conducted in
  accordance with the enterprise plan. Individual organizations should
  pursue information management initiatives which conform to the
  blueprints and priorities established by the enterprise. We will
  change the plan as we need to.

Reliability
^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| Information and information systems are reliable, accurate, relevant
  and timely
| **Rationale**
| The take-up and use of lower cost channels will depend on users of
  services trusting the ability of the organization to provide reliable,
  accurate, relevant and timely information to consumers.
| **Implications**
| Good processes create good data. Processes will need to be the focus
  of ongoing continuous improvement (which in turn will improve
  reliability, accuracy, relevancy and timeliness). Our organization
  needs to deliver information which customers can rely upon.

Reuse and Improve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| Reuse and Improve
| **Rationale**
| As the use of information and communications technologies in
  international development has matured, so too has a base of methods,
  standards, software, platforms, and other technology tools. Yet too
  often we see scarce resources being invested to develop new tools when
  instead existing tools could be adapted and improved. This principle:
  Reuse and Improve highlights ways that adaptation and improvement can
  lead to higher quality resources available to the wider community of
  international development practitioners.
| **Implications**

-  Use, modify and extend existing tools, platforms, and frameworks when
   possible.
-  Develop in modular ways favoring approaches that are interoperable
   over those that are monolithic by design.

| 

Reuse before Buy, Buy before Build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| Prior to acquiring new assets, the company will reuse applicable
  existing information and technology assets. If no existing internal
  asset is available for reuse, the company prefers to acquire, by
  purchasing or licensing, applicable externally available assets. The
  company least preferred option is to custom build a new asset.
| **Rationale**

-  Reusing IT assets (for example, IT systems or data) that are already
   available is often the simplest, quickest, and least expensive
   solution, assuming that the IT assets in question sufficiently fit
   the intended purpose.
-  It is less expensive to buy standard IT solutions than to custom
   build them, as long as they are not adapted and maintenance is left
   to the product supplier.
-  Many authoritative data sources make their data products available
   (or offer data acquisition / generation services), reducing the
   company's need to generate such data itself.
-  Custom development of IT assets is often very expensive to sustain.

| 
| **Implications**

-  When functionality is required, existing IT assets in the
   organization must be evaluated and used first, unless they do not
   exist and/or are a significant mismatch to the required
   functionality.
-  To ensure that IT assets are being reused as much as possible,
   business areas must be prepared to adapt to existing solutions that
   provide adequate functionality, particularly in situations where the
   accountable governance body does not deem that business area’s
   practices to be required to be different from industry standard
   practices.
-  The company will prefer COTS products and particularly those that are
   configurable. Some products are so configurable that there is little
   difference between extensive configuration and custom development.
   The company y must clearly understand when configuration equates to
   custom development (that is, the level of configuration is so high
   that the COTS solution is essentially the same as custom
   development). In these cases, the scenario will change from buy to
   build.
-  Agreements or licenses to use data may have legal implications and
   legal consultation should be part of the process of deciding to use a
   new data source.

| 

Routine Tasks are Automated Where Appropriate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| Routine tasks that can be automated are automated, where the benefit
  justifies the cost.
| **Rationale**

-  Routine tasks require relatively little specific knowledge and can be
   automated fairly easily.
-  Automated tasks are more cost efficient and timeefficient, and less
   errorprone, than manual tasks.
-  Employee capacity requirements can be optimized, freeing them up to
   focus on more complex activities.

| 
| **Implications**

-  The knowledge required to perform certain tasks is analyzed and
   embedded in an IT system when it can be easily formalized.
-  Nonroutine tasks may not be automated.
-  Individual performers will need to be able to automate their own
   tasks. Business areas should integrate automated work flows, where
   one business unit receives another business unit’s automated output
   as its input.

| 

Give before receiving
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| Give before receiving
| **Rationale**
| Giving is the only way to establish a real relationship and a lasting
  connection. Focus solely on what you can get out of the connection and
  you will never make meaningful, mutually beneficial connections and a
  sustainable business
| **Implications**
| Invest time and money in all stakeholder relations.

Information Management is Everybody’s Business
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| All organisations in the enterprise participate in information
  management decisions needed to accomplish business objectives.
| **Rationale**
| Information users are the key stakeholders, or customers, in the
  application of technology to address a business need. In order to
  ensure information management is aligned with the business, all
  organisations in the enterprise must be involved in all aspects of the
  information environment. The business experts from across the
  enterprise and the technical staff responsible for developing and
  sustaining the information environment need to come together as a team
  to jointly deﬁne the goals and objectives of IT.
| **Implications**
| To operate as a team, every stakeholder, or customer, will need to
  accept responsibility for developing the information environment.
  Commitment of resources will be required to implement this principle.

IT Responsibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| The IT organisation is responsible and accountable for owning and
  implementing all IT processes and infrastructure that enable solutions
  to meet business-defined requirements for functionality, service
  levels, cost, and delivery timing. Decisions should always align back
  to the requirement of the Business.
| **Rationale**
| Effectively align expectations with business requirements and our
  overall capabilities so that all projects are cost-effective and can
  be completed in a timely manner. Efficient and effective solutions
  should have reasonable costs and clear benefits relative to the
  business proposition.
| **Implications**
| The IT function must define processes to manage business expectations
  and priorities. Projects must follow an established process to reduce
  costs and to ensure the project has a timely completion. Data,
  information, and technology should be integrated to provide quality
  solutions and to maximise results.

Ease-of-Use
^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| Applications are easy to use for end-users and administrators.
| **Rationale**
| The more a user has to understand the underlying technology, the less
  productive that user is. Avoid mistakes due to difficult comprehension
  interaction with a system. Most of the knowledge required to operate
  one system will be similar to others. Using an application should be
  as intuitive as driving a different car.
| **Implications**

-  The underlying technology is transparent to users.
-  Training is kept to a minimum, and the risk of using a system
   improperly is low.
-  Default (de-facto) GUI's are used for interacting with the system.
-  No large user manual is needed.

| 

Be Collaborative
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| Be Collaborative
| **Rationale**
| The saying: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far,
  go together.” is attributed to an African proverb, but could easily be
  a mantra for technology-enabled development projects. The principle:
  Be Collaborative suggests strategies for leveraging and contributing
  to a broader commons of resource, action, and knowledge to extend the
  impact of development interventions.
| **Implications**

-  Engage diverse expertise across disciplines and industries at all
   stages.
-  Work across sector silos to create coordinated and more holistic
   approaches.
-  Document work, results, processes and best practices and share them
   widely.
-  Publish materials under a Creative Commons license by default, with
   strong rationale if another licensing approach is taken.

| 

Business continuity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| Business continuity of Corporate activities must be maintained,
  despite IT interruptions.
| **Rationale**
| Hardware failures, natural disasters, and lack of data integrity must
  not interrupt business activities.
| **Implications**
| - Recoverability, redundancy, and maintenance must be approached at
  inception. - Applications must be assessed regarding criticality and
  impact on the company's mission to determine which continuity level is
  required and which corresponding recovery plan must be implemented. -
  A business continuity plan must be present/developed.

Business Principle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 
| **Statement**
| These architectural principles will apply to all organisational units
  within the enterprise.
| **Rationale**
| The only way the University will be able to provide a consistent and
  measurable level of appropriately robust, reliable, sustainable
  services and quality information to decision-makers, is if all
  stakeholders abide by the University’s overarching principles for its
  technology, information and business architectures.
| **Implications**
| This fundamental principle will ensure inclusion, consistency,
  fairness and continual alignment to the business. Without this the
  management of our technologies, information and business processes
  would be quickly undermined. Business Partners engaging with the
  business will work to find accommodation between interested parties
  around any conflicts with a principle relevant to the proposal.
